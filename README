DISCLAIMER
==========

This is a past version of McVM, with some parts that are work-in-progress and
not fully working.

BUILD IT
========

The easiest way to compile is to use the bootstrap.sh,
which will populate the /vendor directory with
LLVM and Boehm GC (it already contains Eigen matrix
library in lib/).

Some useful definitions are :
* MCVM_USE_JIT to compile the jit compiler (need LLVM) (recommended)
* MCVM_USE_EIGEN to compile using Eigen as a backend for matrix operations (recommended)
* MCVM_USE_LAPACKE
* MCVM_USE_CLAPACK
* MCVM_USE_DIMVECTOR
* MCVM_USE_PLOTTING

Required libs and headers:
libatlas
liblapacke

Differences from Matlab
=========

Avoid OO, structs, lambda, etc

McVM should be 100% compatible with Matlab syntax. *should*
